Cosplay city is application that serves as a middle point between
a database and a community hub for cosplayers and cosplay 
partners. It serves as a way for cosplayers to display their 
works in an organized and aesthetic manner, that doesn't bury
past projects or burden creativity under the weight of social 
media algorithms. It also is a central forum for cosplayers to 
connect with other con-goers in their fandoms; as well as 
photographers, videographers, or crafts commission-takers to
collaborate with on their upcoming projects.
